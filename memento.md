# Privacy Policy for Memento

No personal information is collected by this app. All data — including goals, settings, and progress — is stored locally on your device. No data is sent to any server or third party.

If you enable widgets, data is shared between the app and its widget extension using a private on-device app group container. This data never leaves your device.

The app may request permission to send local notifications for goal reminders. These notifications are scheduled entirely on-device and do not involve any external service.
