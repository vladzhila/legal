# Privacy Policy for Memento

No personal information is collected by this app. All data — including goals, settings, and progress — is stored locally on your device. No data is sent to any server or third party.

If you enable widgets, data is shared between the app and its widget extension using a private on-device app group container. This data never leaves your device.

You can export your data (goals and settings) as a JSON file and import it back. Exported files are saved to a location you choose and are not sent to any server. You are responsible for any files you share or store outside the app.

The app may request permission to send local notifications for goal reminders. These notifications are scheduled entirely on-device and do not involve any external service.
