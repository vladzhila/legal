# Terms of Use for Memento

By using Memento, you agree to these terms.

## The App

Memento is a progress tracking app for iOS. It visualizes the passage of time through life, year, and day progress bars, and lets you create custom goals with target dates and reminders.

## Your Data

All data — including goals, settings, and personal inputs like birth year — is stored locally on your device. You can back up your data by exporting it as a file, and restore it by importing a backup. Importing replaces all existing goals and settings. You are responsible for your own data — if you delete the app without a backup, your data will be lost.

## Acceptable Use

You may use the app for personal progress tracking purposes. You may not reverse-engineer, modify, or redistribute the app.

## Disclaimer

The app is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Progress calculations, including life progress estimates, are approximations and should not be relied upon for any critical purpose. I am not liable for any data loss, missed reminders, or any other damages arising from the use of this app.

## Changes

These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.
