# Privacy Policy for Money

All your financial data — including transactions, categories, and preferences — is stored locally on your device using SwiftData.

If you enable iCloud sync, your transactions and categories are synced across your devices using Apple's CloudKit. This data is stored in your private iCloud account and is not accessible to us or any third party. Local preferences such as app lock settings and appearance mode remain on-device and are not synced.

If you enable widgets, data is shared between the app and its widget extension using a private on-device app group container. This data never leaves your device.

The app may request permission to use Face ID or Touch ID for app lock. Biometric data is handled entirely by Apple's LocalAuthentication framework and is never accessed by the app.

You may export your data as CSV files and import them back at your own discretion. Exported files are saved to locations you choose and are not sent to any external service.

In-app purchases are handled entirely by Apple through StoreKit. Payment information is managed by Apple and is never accessed by the app.

No analytics, crash reporting, or tracking of any kind is used. No personal information is collected or shared with third parties.
