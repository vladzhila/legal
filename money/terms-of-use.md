# Terms of Use for Money

By using Money, you agree to these terms.

## The App

Money is a personal finance tracking app for iOS. It allows you to record income and expenses, view statistics and analytics, and sync data across devices via iCloud. The app offers both free and paid (Money Pro) tiers.

## Your Data

Your financial data is stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud sync, it is also stored in your private iCloud account. You are responsible for your own data — if you delete the app without a backup, your data will be lost. You may export and import your data as CSV files at your own discretion.

## In-App Purchases

Money Pro is available as a monthly subscription, annual subscription, or one-time lifetime purchase. Payments are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. Subscription management and cancellation are handled through your Apple ID settings.

## Acceptable Use

You may use the app for personal finance tracking purposes. You may not reverse-engineer, modify, or redistribute the app.

## Disclaimer

The app is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. I am not liable for any data loss, inaccurate calculations, or any other damages arising from the use of this app.

## Changes

These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.
