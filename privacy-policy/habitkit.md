# Privacy Policy for HabitKit

All your habit data — including habits, completions, settings, and progress — is stored locally on your device. No personal information is collected or shared with third parties.

If you enable widgets, data is shared between the app and its widget extension using a private on-device app group container. This data never leaves your device.

The app may request permission to send local notifications for habit reminders. These notifications are scheduled entirely on-device and do not involve any external service.

HabitKit uses Sentry for anonymous crash reporting in production builds. This includes error messages and stack traces to help diagnose issues. No personally identifiable information is collected — Sentry is configured with personal data collection explicitly disabled.

In-app purchases are handled entirely by Apple through StoreKit. Payment information is managed by Apple and is never accessed by the app.
