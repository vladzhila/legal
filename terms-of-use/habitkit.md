# Terms of Use for HabitKit

By using HabitKit, you agree to these terms.

## The App

HabitKit is a habit tracking app for iOS. It allows you to create habits, track daily completions, view statistics, and set reminders. The app offers both free and paid (HabitKit Pro) tiers.

## Your Data

All habit data is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for your own data — if you delete the app, your data will be lost. You may export and import your data as JSON files at your own discretion.

## In-App Purchases

HabitKit Pro is available as a monthly subscription, annual subscription, or one-time lifetime purchase. Payments are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. Subscription management and cancellation are handled through your Apple ID settings.

## Acceptable Use

You may use the app for personal habit tracking purposes. You may not reverse-engineer, modify, or redistribute the app.

## Disclaimer

The app is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. I am not liable for any data loss, missed reminders, or any other damages arising from the use of this app.

## Changes

These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.
